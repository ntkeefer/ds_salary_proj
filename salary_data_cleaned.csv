What You'll Do

You will integrate disparate EHR, clinical, claims, and other medical data sources, extracting consistent information across ontologies, and deriving insights from disparate data sources to allow experts to rapidly understand the meaning, applicability, and extensibility of results from observational and randomized clinical experimentation. You will build ML tools for anomaly-tracking to enable rapid, more effective clinical trialing and the integration of data sources throughout the life sciences. You will model the trajectory of disease across patient populations to identify key opportunities and indications and to rapidly test and develop candidate medicines.

You will map and optimize the complex interrelationships of pharma companies, drug manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers, payors, and patients to drive EQRxs strategy to dramatically lower drug prices while promoting equity and access. You will use novel computational techniques to design, refine, and select novel drug candidates. Using the tools of modern data science and machine learning, you will help to build a data driven, end-to-end digital native life sciences company, enabling our core mission of rapid, equal, and equitable access to medicines.

The Impact You'll Have
You will help to radically lower drug prices and expand access, by identifying novel opportunities for partnerships and delivery across the complex web of interrelationships that bring drugs from pharma companies to patients. You will speed the development and trialing of novel medicines through the unification, comprehension, and modelling of human health and disease across data sources. You will drive the adoption of machine learning for the improvement of human health in building a radically different, digital-native and data-first life sciences company, where we bootstrap our way to rapid increases in scale and efficacy across functions. You will enable experts across EQRx to see further, connecting data from biology and chemistry, to the clinic and patients, to drug pricing and delivery, powering a novel, modern paradigm in drug development.

In addition, patients can support new medical breakthroughs if they choose to contribute their anonymized medical histories to studies PicnicHealth sponsors with leading researchers. Patients get the PicnicHealth service free of charge, life sciences researchers get critical data on how diseases look in the real world, and academic researchers get free access to data sets that drive cutting edge medical research.

It's an exciting time to join the PicnicHealth team - we just announced our Series B raise and are growing quickly in revenue, partnerships, and people. We 3x'd our ARR two years in a row now and on track to continue this trend, building partnerships with over a dozen Life Sciences groups, including 3 of the top 6 Biopharma firms in the US. We're going through a period of hyper-growth - we tripled the size of the team in the last 18 months and we're looking to at least double over the next year. We have a collaborative and engaged team culture that is mission driven and excited about the technology we're building and real solutions we're offering patients.

The Opportunity

We are building up our team of talented data scientists to arm these teams with data-driven insights to make informed operational and strategic decisions. This role provides a unique opportunity to work with continuous real-world operations data, to be tightly coupled to the actions taken based on one's analyses, and to drive significant impact within PicnicHealth's core business.

You have a strong desire to shape our growing team of data scientists as PicnicHealth scales to meet customer demand. You are a kind, passionate, and collaborative problem-solver who seeks and gives candid feedback.

4.1",2018,Enterprise Software & Network Solutions,"ABNORMAL SECURITY.

Abnormal Security is defining the next generation of email security defense. Our platform uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to baseline communication content, user identity, and behavioral signals in real-time and at-scale in order to detect the abnormalities of email attacks.

Customers love us because we consistently detect and stop what everyone else in the market can't -- advanced attacks that have never been seen before -- and we do so with beautiful user interfaces and best-in-industry customer support.

Our veteran team has built some of the most enduring machine learning platforms at leading companies including Google, Twitter, Pinterest, Amazon, Microsoft, and Expanse. We are located in San Francisco and New York City.

Our company is growing - we're on the Forbes AI 50, and a Gartner 2020 Cool Vendor, and our customer base includes multiple Fortune 500 companies.

We are tackling complex and unsolved problems. In order to build the best in class detection of cyber attacks, we need to constantly push the boundaries of our detection system and answer questions such as:
What classes of FN and FPs are we missing?
What additional signals do we need in order to capture these FNs and FPs?
How can we best capture and iterate on a never-before-seen attack?
How do we know a model / feature is working as expected?
What dimensions do we need to evaluate in order to tackle a problem like this at scale with an extremely low False Positive Rate?
YOU:

You want to dig into massive amounts of data to understand what kind of attacks are being delivered. As a Data Scientist, you will drive generating a deep organizational understanding of the attack landscape and work across product/engineering to make sure we are building the best cyber security product in the market. You will spend your time:
Think about how to quantify the world that email security operates in including: attack patterns, model behavior, human behavior, impact etc.
Evaluate quality of the detection product and identify areas of improvements
Experiment with ways to identify product gaps and assess potential solutions
Come up with new methods to capture unremediated risk in the email environment
Generate insights to share with internal team and industry partners
Qualification:
2+ years of experience in a Data Science function working with big data
Ability to work in a highly autonomous manner
Comfortable solving undefined problems
MS / PhD in an analytical field such as Math, Physics, Computer Science, or Economics
Fluent in Python and SQL
Good understanding of statistical methods and ML concepts
Nice to have:
Experience in cyber security or fraud detection
Experience working with a ML-based product
